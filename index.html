                    <div class="tab-panel"><br><br><p class="text-in-blog">I graduated Case Western Reserve University with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology 
                        and Cognitive Science and, upon graduation, I worked at a neuropsychiatry lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
                        The lab primarily investigated short-term memory in first-episode schizophrenia patients using functional MRI scans.
                         From this experience, I learned how integral computer science has become in neuroscience research, 
                         and I wanted to gain a better theoretical knowledge of that disipline. To help me achieve this goal, 
                         I enrolled at Northeastern University's ALIGN Master of Science in Computer Science, where I hope to 
                         gain the skills and knowledge to advance my career in research.</p><br>

                        His research interests include big data, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, database systems, 
                        data visualization, and deep learning. More information can be found at his Northeastern webpage, located

                    <div class="tab-panel"><br><br><p class="text-in-blog">The aim of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network that is able to identify a child or adolescent's 
                        age based on their structural MRI brain scan. Being able to create models that identify age based on an image of a person's brain 
                        could eventually be used to predict psychiatric or neurological diseases. Data is provided by the Human Connectome Project, and the age ranges of this
                        model will be between 5 and 21 years of age. <br><br>

                        More information will be added as the project progresses. Below are the milestones I hope to reach each

                        <p class = "text-in-blog"> This week, I designed my research project. 
                        To come up with the idea, I went through neuroscience literature 
                        that used machine learning models on MRI images to predict certain outcomes. 
                        Throughout my search, I was surprised that most articles researched healthy 
                        adults instead of healthy children. This gave me an idea of a target 
                        demographic that may be interesting to investigate.<br><br>

                        Abnormal development in childhood is thought to be linked to certain 
                        psychopathology and neurodevelopmental disorders. As such, creating 
                        models to map the trajectory of development starting young may be helpful 
                        in identifying certain diseases. One metric used to mark this development 
                        is called "brain age," or what the typical brain should look like given a child's age. 
                        Studies used T1 and T2 MRI scans to create deep learning models that were able to 
                        accurately predict the age of the child.<br><br>

                        I wanted to explore this concept more. I created a rough draft of this idea 
                        and presented it to my research advisor. The next steps would be to get access
                        to the dataset, which may take a while. </p><br><br> 

                        <p class = "month-title">September 3 - September 8 </p> 
                        <p class="text-in-blog">The dataset finally gained approval, and I should have all the data for my project. I used the 
                        remainder of this week to put all the important components together on my website and to fimilarize
                        myself with the dataset. I will edit the 
                        style of the website throughout the semester, 
                        but I will begin to focus primarily on my project. <br><br>
                        
                        Next week, I will begin looking over the data to figure out pre-processing and features for my model.
                        If pre-processing steps need to be completed, I will develop the script and start the process on 
                        Discovery or the Northeastern servers.  </p><br><br>
